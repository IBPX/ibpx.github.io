Welcome to DORK!

You are on a flight North, descending a few hours before schedule.
You've tryed to get some sleep on this flight.
While you slept, all the passengers and pilots parachuted down,
and no one bothered to wake you.
There doesn't seem to be any parachutes left.

You are above water, and there is no land in sight.
